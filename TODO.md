# To Do
* Implement the C++ language support by implementing CPPCodeAnalyzer.
* Look into making a CommentParser object that can then be added to a CodeAnalyzer. This would then handle comment parsing. This way, languages which share comment styles share code for comment parsing and you can begin to build CodeAnalyzers by mixing and matching parts.
